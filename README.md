# Laser Timer PWA — Bullseye v2f (iPhone‑optimized, 1″ marker friendly)

**What’s new**
- Re‑Calibrate button truly restarts calibration (clears timer + `H`).
- Persistent calibration: keeps last good `H`, shows “Reacquiring…” instead of dropping session.
- High‑res calibration → low‑res 60fps gameplay path (great for iPhone).
- Status shows `markers: N | ~PxWide` so you can check 1″ viability (aim ≥ 60px).
- CLAHE equalization helps in dim/uneven light.
- Slightly softer red thresholds for iPhone white balance.
